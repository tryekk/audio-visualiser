# Customisable Cross-Platform Audio Visualiser


### How to build/start/run/compile the project

#### macOS:
Clone the GitHub project.<br>
Open the folder named 'AudioVisualiserApp'.<br>
Run the file 'AudioVisualiser.app'.<br><br>
*Please make sure that you allow microphone permission or have an alternative audio input device connected to your computer (such as an audio interface with an instrumant as an input).*
<br>
#### Windows:
Need to try out in VS on Windows!

### Links to the documentation/websites of the frameworks, languages, libraries I used and why they have been used

*C++ programming language (Microsoft documentation):
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/?view=msvc-170*
<br><br>
I decided to use C++ for this project because of the frameworks available to use for creating graphics and for processing digital audio data.
<br><br>
C++ is a very flexible language that allows for deep control over system resources and processor behaviour. Because of this, it can run faster than most languages of similar ability and allows for a fine level of control that enables efficient execution of complex code â€“ enabling real-time displays for dynamic audio data.
<br><br>

*JUCE audio processing and graphics framework for C++:
https://docs.juce.com/master/index.html*
<br><br>
This framework was used for handling audio inputs and processing their digital audio data.
I also used this framework for cresting the GUI and graphical elements of the application, such as the audio visualiser component itself and the GUI used to customise/control the visualiser.
<br><br>
This framework was used in addition to the C++ standard library primarily due to the fact that it has built-in functions that handle audio input data. This was a huge time saver for me as the algorithm for processing audio data (Fast Fourier Transform / FFT) already exists and has been implemented in the JUCE framework. This meant that I did not need to reinvent the wheel and kept the project within the scope of the time requirement.
<br><br>
Another reason for its use was that it includes a graphics library that enabled me to make a clean and clear GUI within the scope of the project time.
<br><br>
Another important reason is that JUCE is cross-platform.<br>
I wanted the application to be available to as many users as possible, and for its platform support to not get in the way of a production, such as a studio or event needing to hire a certain machine in order to use the application
